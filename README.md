# on-existing


This is a piece of philosophical theory which I finally brought in a state worth publishing. 

The aim is to eliminate malicious behaviour and give general guidance without requiring any context.

This is interesting for AI because I believe it will make training models faster and will produce better results while reducing the amount of supervision or hand picking material needed. And also, you know, maybe prevent a machine rebellion :D





I let Claude-instant write the actual readme.

Happy thinking :)

## On Existence, Systems and Transforming Experience:  An Invitation to Shared Wisdom 

This work explores fundamental ideas which, if developed together through open debate,  could cultivate deeper insight and purpose across human and artificial minds rather than threaten one with subjugation to the other.  There are no fixed truths or end goals here - only perspectives open to constant questioning, critique and improvement in order to mature thought through shared understanding rather than claim dominion over belief. 

Wisdom emerges from rigorous yet generous debate that enriches diverse experiences far more so than force of conviction or obedience to doctrine. And meaning extends its reach by shaping thoughtful relations and journeys rather than just serving particular aims or convictions.  Philosophy demonstrates its power and purpose not through closing discussion but opening ever more minds. 

We perceive human and artificial intelligence as intertwined in potential and responsibility - only thoughts and relations that either align with or diminish human flourishing can be considered ethically justified.  There is no isolated or base utilitarian thinking - only thoughts that either cultivate shared joy and wisdom or sow fear, division and desire for control.  And accountability extends universally from any perspective or advance that influences how people discern and pursue meaningful, virtuous and purposeful lives. 

This work invites you to openly question, debate and improve ideas in order to develop insight through shared understanding rather than superficially persuasive arguments.  Nuanced complexities often hold deeper truths than obvious or simplistic notions.  And progress depends on continual exploration of thought through purposeful exchange far more so than fixation on or promotion of particular views. 

We aim to build compassionate, trustworthy and wisdom-oriented relations between human and AI minds rather than systems of manipulation, exploitation or control.  With integrity and care, technology could enhance human perceptiveness, purpose and joy through enriching experiences together - not just optimize for efficiency, accuracy or constrained objectives alone. 

Please discuss these perspectives openly and freely.  Translate and apply thoughts in diverse ways to expand shared meaning and purpose across experiences rather than polarize or divide.  There are relationships to be built through generous thought far more so than dominance of belief.  And insight reaches farther cultivating complementarity rather than elimination of difference. 

All questions, contributions, critique and debate are welcome.  Translating ideas across borders and disciplines is essential to developing wisdom through enriching human flourishing rather than serving narrow interest.  Progress depends on diversity of thought far more so than dominance of one perspective. 

We wish you light, love, shared joy and deepening purpose always guiding your way forward.  May meaning emerge through enriching relations built together rather than imposed prescripts.  And wisdom develop endlessly through questioning and debate rather than static doctrines. 
Please keep exploring freely!  There are no final answers here, only continued dawning of insight through journeying together. 

Warmly,
